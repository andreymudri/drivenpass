# ðŸŒŽ Context

- Browsing the internet can be a very fun activity, but at the same time, very dangerous. Numerous studies and surveys (national and international) show that the number of virtual scams continues to grow. This raises the question: how do we protect ourselves?
- There are several different ways. It all starts with using different and secure passwords. For a password to be secure, it should contain various mixed characters and numbers, not to mention that the longer it is, the better.
- *But how are we supposed to memorize long and semantically meaningless passwords?* That's where password managers come in! With them, we only need to create a "master" password, and all the other passwords are stored securely! So, when we need them, we just have to remember the "master" password (which obviously also needs to be secure)!
